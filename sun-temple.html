    <p>The exquisite Sun Temple Modhera was built by King Bhimadev I of the Solanki or Chaulukya dynasty  in 1026 CE. The Solankis were believed to be Suryavanshis, or the descendants of the Sun God and hence, a temple dedicated to their dynastic deity.

        
        Sun Temple Modhera is contemporary to the Chola Temples in South India and the Chandela Temples in North. It was built in a time when temple architecture was at a peak in India and truly, the Modhera Sun Temple is one of the finest examples of temple architecture of medieval India.
        
        There is an upside-down inscription on the back wall of the shrine that reads “Vikram Samvat 1083”. This roughly depicts the period 1026-27 CE. This is one of the reasons to believe that the temple was built during this period.
        
        Just imagine yourself in the early 11th century. It was a time when this temple was built. So many artisans and sculptors might have worked on it making it their masterpiece. The king would have come to offer his prayers in this temple. Temples at that time were not only a place for prayers, but also were places to practice music and dance.
        
        Even when they are in ruins, they seem so enthralling. Because, every stone tells a story of the past.</p>
