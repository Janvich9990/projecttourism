<p><h3>Rani-ki-Vav, on the banks of the Saraswati River, was initially built as a memorial to a
king in the 11th century AD. Stepwells are a distinctive form of subterranean water resource and

storage systems on the Indian subcontinent, and have been constructed since the 3rd
millennium BC. They evolved over time from what was basically a pit in sandy soil towards
elaborate multi-storey works of art and architecture. Rani-ki-Vav was built at the height of
craftsmensâ€™ ability in stepwell construction and the Maru-Gurjara architectural style, reflecting
mastery of this complex technique and great beauty of detail and proportions. Designed as an
inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, it is divided into seven levels of stairs with
sculptural panels of high artistic quality; more than 500 principle sculptures and over a thousand
minor ones combine religious, mythological and secular imagery, often referencing literary
works. The fourth level is the deepest and leads into a rectangular tank 9.5 m by 9.4 m, at a
depth of 23 m. The well is located at the westernmost end of the property and consists of a shaft
10 m in diameter and 30 m deep.</h3></p>
